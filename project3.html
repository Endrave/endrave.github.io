  <p class="w3-large">When we first start, we put our focus on how people get attracted to purchase items. Which leads us to the point of "crowd effect", people will get curious when seeing group of people are focus on an event. Which this efffect can be recreated in VR enviroment.</p>
  <p class="w3-large">Then we look in to the diffculties, we found that a multi national VR platfrom will face language barrier and discriminate the sign-language user, such they become one of our target group in our design.</p>
  <p class="w3-large">Finally we brainstormed the users communication patten. Including customer to customer, customer to shop owner. Based on this, we found out user can only obtain limited information from this channel. Such our system should provide customer to bot communication to enable the customer to obtain more technical information and customer to stranger to seek other information such a new events or reviews. </p>

		  <h1 class="w3-center">WOW Factors</p></h1>
		  <p>There are mainly 4 WOW factors in <i>VeRse</i> to make it stands out from other current proudcts.</p>
		  <p style="font-size:20px"><b> Multilingual</b></p>
		  <p> As a global online shopping center, we need to cater the user from all around the world, many bussiness are lost due to language barrier. Yet in VeRse there is <b>no such thing</b>, proximity translator take care of it and make every mulinational trading smooth.</p>
		  <p style="font-size:20px"><b> Handler Kun</b></p>
		  <p> Everyone should have the right to use our platform, including disablies. Therefore, Handler kun is here to help to solve the Sign-language translation issue. Such that even mute and hearing impairing user can also enjoy the experience in VeRse. In addition, all the custom hand gesture data can be inherit from the Handler App.<p>		  
		  <p style="font-size:20px"><b> MART-E Chan</b></p>
		  <p> To make shopping easier and smarter, MART-E Chan is you shopping companion to bring your experience into next level <br>
		  1. Voice command: No more typing and clicking. MART-E is an intellgent chat bot accept voice command. If you got question just tell her.<br>
		  2. Humanloid interface: MART-E Chan is not like Siri or miss Google with no face, MART-E are designed with humanloid body to give facial expression, hand gestures and eye contact when you are talking with her. So you cacn talk to her naturally just like to friend.
		  3. Map location: Got loss in VeRse, no problem! just tell MART-E chan , she will show you the map and teleport you to there if you want.
		  4. Smart shopping: As inherit from MART-E App, she can help you to sort the search result with rating and price. Now she can also bookmark the shop you like, perform service booking. 
		  </p>
		  <p style="font-size:20px"><b> 24/7 Trustworthy Shop</b></p>
		  <p> Crimes, high labour cost, high overhead cost when running a physical shop. Worry the good will be damage by customer. 
		  <br>-All this will "NOT" happen in VeRse.
		  <br>-Shoplifting Free enviroment: Since all the good are virtual, nothing can actually be "steal".
		  <br>-24/7 working bot: Bot can be deploy to handle basic customer request, such that can reduce the human worker working hour and let bot to run the store.
		  <br>-Infinity space: there are no physical space constrain in VeRse, such owner can run a big showroom with low cost in VeRse easily , but they can't do in realility. Also it take less construction time to build a 3D scene than a physical space.
		  <br>-People like touching: People always like to touch to test before they purchase, in real shop,many good might got damage due to touch. In internet shopping, customer can't touch, so owner loss bussiness due to that. But in VeRse, item can be implement with physics and allow user to move around freely with out doing any damage.

      <h1 class="w3-center">Evaulation</h1><br>
      <h5>User-testing</h5>
	  <p>We had demo our design to sereval peoples, these are the feedbacks:
	  <br>
	  <br>Pros:
	  <br>- is a merit to able to rotate the object freely
	  <br>- the translator can bring different user around the world closly together
	  <br>
	  <br>Cons:
	  <br>- the text-to-speech is still sounds very robotic, which bring down the experienece
	  <br>- the graphic quailities are way too low, poor visual element make overall feeling looks "fake", but not "real" in "virtual reality"
	  <br>- how to handle the nay-sayer in the VR world?
	  <br>
	  <br>To conclude the completeness have tremendous impact on the overall experience. If visuals, audios are simply not close too normal real life feelings, user will have sense of weird feeling as it mismatch with the nature. As such, to make this design fesible enough to launch to public, we have to refine the graphic and audio to give more smooth experience. 
	  
	  
	  </p>
	  <h1 class="w3-center">Contribution</h1><br>
	  
	  <p>In this project, I had worked on:
	  <br>- Script writing
	  <br>- Actor and scene shooting
	  <br>- Text-to-speech and fine tuning with Audacity
	  <br>- Car stage building
	  <br>- UI making
	  <br>- Create MART-E chan VRM model and related animation
	  
	  
	  </p>
  </div>
   
   
  
   
  <div class="w3-row w3-padding-64" >
    <div class="w3-col l6 w3-padding-large">
      <h1 class="w3-center">Personal Reflection</h1><br>
      <p >In project <i>Handler</i>
		<br>- I learnt how to use blender to create glb elements.
		<br>- I learnt how to use SSSL text to speech powered by IBM to create diffent expression tone
		<br></p>
		
		<p>I this project, we aimed to create a better VR communication platform by intergrated with our past projects to solve the diffculties in real-life communication or shopping. With our integration, translator will help to solve the multi-lingue and sign-language issue, there is no pressure for the indecisive customer, there is no shoplifting issue. In terms of functionaility, we have done a good job. Yet, the entire system is not detail enough, for example, the text-to-speech still sound very robitic ,3D model looks too unreal and the cartoon like avater cannot create a human to human like comunication feeling. Which implys we still have rooms to improve.</p>
		<p>In addition, our experience on Hubs is, it is kind of fragile.
		<br>- It cannot hold more than 128 MB model
		<br>- The link to the 3D model in sketchfab might went wrong sometime
		<br>- imported glb element always have texture missing issue
		<br>- Spoke cannot edit by multi-user at the same time
		<br> It might be a good platform to build protoype for single user, but it is really hard to work in a group project.</p>
